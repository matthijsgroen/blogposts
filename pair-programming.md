Pair programming
================

Forms of pair programming I have seen:

 - The intern
 - The I-know-it-all
 - The I-dont-care

Problems: Not equally leveled!

What pair programming is not about

What pair programming *is* about

- Asking yourselves questions

  - Is this in de scope of this story?
  - Are we introducing technical debt?
  - Is this a good start?
  - Is this a good test?
  - Is this readable? Understandable?
  - Are we repeating ourselves?
  - Does this reveal intent?

- Use the whiteboard!
